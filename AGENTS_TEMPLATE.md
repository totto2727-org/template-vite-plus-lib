```

## Development commands

### Execution rules

- Run commands from the repository root inside `nix develop`.
- Use Vite+ for both formatting and linting, source type checks, tests, and library packaging.
- Keep temporary consumers and package archives under ignored `tmp/` and out of commits.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` canonical without creating `CLAUDE.md`.

### Standard tasks

- `nix develop`: Enter the pinned development environment.
- `vp install --frozen-lockfile`: Install locked development dependencies.
- `vp run fix`: Apply Vite+ formatting and supported lint fixes with `vp check --fix`.
- `vp run check`: Verify formatting, lint rules, and inherited strictest source types through the cached `vp check` task.
- `vp run test`: Run tests through Vite+ once with task caching.
- `vp run build`: Build the ESM library and TypeScript declarations with `vp pack`, restoring `dist/**` on cache hits.
- `vp run ci`: Run check, test, and build in parallel, followed by package contents validation after build.
- `vp run --no-cache ci`: Execute the same task graph without caching when fresh validation is needed.
- `vp run package`: Build or restore the library, then inspect npm package contents without publishing.
- `npm pack --dry-run`: Inspect package contents after `vp pack` without publishing.
- `npm pack --pack-destination tmp`: Create a real consumer archive after creating `tmp/` and running `vp pack`.
- `actionlint .github/workflows/ci.yml .github/workflows/publish.yml.disabled`: Validate both workflow definitions without enabling publication. Supply actionlint separately when needed.

## Architecture

### Public library boundary

- Export the consumer API from `src/index.ts` and test that public entry point.
- Keep `package.json` export conditions aligned with `dist/index.js` and `dist/index.d.ts`, with `types` before `import`.
- This package is ESM-only. Do not imply CommonJS support without adding and validating that output.
- `vp check` checks source types, but does not prove declarations reach consumers. For export changes, install a real npm archive into an isolated consumer under `tmp/`, compile imports by package name with strict NodeNext resolution, check rejected invalid calls, and execute the built exports.

## Development tools

- **Vite+**: Both formatter and linter use the configuration in `vite.config.ts` through `vp check`. Tests use `vite-plus/test`. `vp pack` delegates library builds and declaration generation to tsdown. `vp build` invokes Vite production builds and does not natively emit declarations, so the cache-aware `build` task invokes `vp pack` without a declaration plugin.
- **Task caching**: Vite+ configuration tasks, including `fix`, cache by default. The `ci` dependency graph allows check, test, and build to run concurrently and orders package inspection after build. Build inputs use automatic tracking except `dist/**`. Explicit `output: ["dist/**"]` restores JavaScript and declarations on cache hits. Vite+ automatically declines to cache a `fix` run that reads and rewrites the same input, while unchanged runs can hit cache. Keep `dist/` ignored so concurrent checks do not scan generated files. Do not use `--parallel` to bypass package inspection's build dependency.
- **TypeScript**: `tsconfig.json` extends the exact `@tsconfig/strictest` 2.0.8 dependency, retaining inherited strictness including `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` and `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`. Local options specify the ESM/NodeNext runtime and no-emit source checks, not duplicate preset flags.
- **Nix flakes**: Pin the development shell only. The external Vite+ input overlay installs tooling, not a package/CLI overlay exported by this library. The global CLI and local vite-plus dependency are pinned independently. Bun is present for the shared npm publication action.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI runs `setup-nix@main`, then `setup-typescript@main` with `--frozen-lockfile`, loads the environment with `eval "$(nix print-dev-env "$GITHUB_WORKSPACE#default")"`, and runs `vp run ci`. Keep shared `totto2727-org/monorepo` actions on `@main`.

## Package-specific rules

- Keep all existing formatter defaults, including no semicolons, single quotes, print width 120, and preserved Markdown wrapping.
- Keep `files: ["dist"]` aligned with generated outputs. Update `pnpm-lock.yaml` when dependencies change and `flake.lock` when Nix inputs change.
- Do not introduce `package.nix`, Nix package or CLI overlay outputs, CLI installation routes, or Nix build CI.
- Keep README usage consumer-focused, document all public exports, and use only supported dependency installation paths. Do not claim npm availability before the package exists.
- Keep `private: true` and `publish.yml.disabled` until the package owner configures npm trusted publishing for the exact GitHub owner, repository, and workflow filename `publish.yml`. If an initial package publication is required to create registry settings, the owner must perform it manually. Permit direct publishing, not staged-only publishing. Match any configured environment with a protected workflow job environment.
- Before enabling publication, review package metadata, third-party action pins, protected release tags, and a real packed consumer. Remove `private: true` and rename the disabled file to `publish.yml` only after registry linking. Use a protected `v<version>` tag matching the manifest from a validated commit.
- Retain job-scoped `id-token: write` and a GitHub-hosted runner. Do not add long-lived registry tokens. The publish workflow installs locked dependencies, runs `vp pack`, then calls `publish-npm@main` with the required `working-directory: .`. It must not duplicate pre-merge checks, tests, or dry runs.
- The shared publish action uses `bun publish` and skips versions already present on the registry. Use a new version for changed contents. Keep the workflow disabled or remove it when publication is not wanted.
